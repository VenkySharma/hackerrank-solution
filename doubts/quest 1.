why we write to take input as list(map(int, input().split()))


Answer:python take every input as a single string 
     as 
>>> b = input()
4 5 6 7 8 3 4 5 6
>>> b
'4 5 6 7 8 3 4 5 6'
>>> type(b)
<class 'str'>
     here we see the above code we give the input as space separated integers but it take whole input as a single string
     
>>> c = input().split()
4 5 6 7 8 3 4 5 6
>>> c
['4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '3', '4', '5', '6']
>>> type(c)
<class 'list'>
 when we do split() it convert the whole input to list of our input by differentiating with separator(here separator is spaces(" "))
 
 
 >>> c = input().split(",")
2,3,4,56,7,8,9
>>> c
['2', '3', '4', '56', '7', '8', '9']
 
 here separator is comma, by default separator is space if we provide no arguements in split() function
 
 
 map is used to convert iterator by passing through a function
 when we use map(int,list)
 it convert each element of list by pasiing through int function
 
 
 lastly we use list again to convert to list of input
