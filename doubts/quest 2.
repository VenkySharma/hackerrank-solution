    above line number 2 and 3 for above half of the pattern
    4 th for middle
    and 5 and 6th for the rest
    you can do it in your own way
    
    
     center() function takes two arguements one maximum character of string in a single line
     and what to print (by default space) by doing left and right padding itself
     
     2nd and 3rd line print (.|.) 2i+1 for each i where width of string is m and in left and right it print("-")
      similarly it does for the rest
